<h1>Project Overview</h1>
In this project, the team is tasked with designing and developing a software
simulation of the AED Plus (Automated External Defibrillator Plus) system, a life-saving medical
device used to assist individuals in cardiac emergencies.
The goal of this project is to design and implement a simplified software simulation of the AED
Plus device to demonstrate its functionality and provide user interaction.

<h1>Objective</h1>
The objective of this project is to create a software simulation that mimics the core
functionality of an AED Plus device allowing users to perform actions such as
analyzing heart rhythms, providing electric shocks, and offering guidance during an emergency.
All the technical information regarding the AED Plus is contained in the AED Plus
